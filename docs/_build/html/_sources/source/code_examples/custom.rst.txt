Custom plot
===========

:class:`FigureBuilder <whatstk.FigureBuilder>` provides some tools to easily visualize your chat. However, the possible
visualizations are infinite. Here, we provide some examples of a custom visualization using some library tools together
with pandas and plotly.


Number of messages vs. Number of characters sent
------------------------------------------------
For each user, we will obtain a 2D scatter plot measuring the number of messages and characters sent in a day. That is,
for a given user we will have `N` points, where `N` is the number of days that the user has sent at least one message.
Each point corresponds to a day, where the x-axis and the y-axis measure the number of messages sent and the average
number of characters per message in that day, respectively.


First of all, lets instatiate objects :class:`WhatsAppChat<whatstk.WhatsAppChat>` (chat loading) and
:class:`FigureBuilder <whatstk.FigureBuilder>` (figure coloring).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from whatstk import WhatsAppChat, FigureBuilder
    >>> from whatstk.data import whatsapp_urls
    >>> chat = WhatsAppChat.from_source(filepath=whatsapp_urls.LOREM_2000)
    >>> fb = FigureBuilder(chat=chat)

Next, we obtain the number of messages and number of characters sent per user per day.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from whatstk.analysis import get_interventions_count
    >>> counts_interv = get_interventions_count(chat=chat, date_mode='date', msg_length=False, cummulative=False)
    >>> counts_len = get_interventions_count(chat=chat, date_mode='date', msg_length=True, cummulative=False)

Time to process a bit the data. We obtain a DataFrame with five columns:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> #Â Create dfs
    >>> counts_len = pd.DataFrame(counts_len.unstack(), columns=['num_characters'])
    >>> counts_interv = pd.DataFrame(counts_interv.unstack(), columns=['num_interventions'])
    >>> # Combine #messages and #characters
    >>> counts = counts_len.merge(counts_interv, left_index=True, right_index=True)
    >>> # Remove all zero entries
    >>> counts = counts[~(counts['num_interventions'] == 0)].reset_index()
    >>> counts['avg_length'] = counts['num_characters']/counts['num_interventions']
    >>> counts.head(5)
             username       date  num_characters  num_interventions  avg_length
