# whatsapp-stats

This project is in current development. Its purpose is to provide a set of tools to detect some hidden patterns in whatsapp group chats.

Test the program running `python main.py < file.in`, where file.in is the chat you want to analyze.

### Comments on `file.in`

Email the chat of your whatsapp group using your phone. To do so, got to the group conversation, click the three dots (up-right) and select More. Finally, click on Email chat.
