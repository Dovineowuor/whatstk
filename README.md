whatstk is a Python module for WhatsApp chat group analysis and distributed under the GPL-3.0 license.

The project was started in December 2016 by [lucasrodes](https://github.com/lucasrodes) and [albertaparicio](https://github.com/albertaparicio).


### Installation

#### Dependencies

This project uses some of the most common Python libraries:

- NumPy (>= 1.12)
- Pandas (>= 0.19.2)

Use the requirements.txt file to install all dependencies

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


We highly recommended to install these dependencies inside a virtual environment to keep them isolated from the rest of the system. For how to setup a virtual environment, take a look at [SETVENV.md](SETVENV.md).

For running the examples, Jupyter Notebook is required.
