whatstk is a Python module for WhatsApp chat group analysis and distributed under the GPL-3.0 license.

:star: Please **star** our project if you found it interesting to **keep us motivated** :smiley:!
### Installation

First download the repo.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lucasrodes/whatstk.git
$ cd whatstk
```

It is assumed that you are using Python 3. Next, you can install all its dependencies by running

```
$ bash install_dependencies.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment named `.whatstk` and installs all the python libraries required in the project. You can now
start the virtual environment by running

```
$ source .whatstk/bin/activate
```


Find more details in [install_dependencies.sh](install_dependencies.sh).
This is due to your directory being located within a path with spaces (more info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911003/cant-install-via-pip-with-virtualenv)). Please use a path without spaces!

### Header Support
The header of the chat log texts varies depending on your phone settings. We are making our best to provide support for all of them, but some might not be yet covered. Please check the list of [supported headers](supported_headers.md) and report an issue if yours is not supported!

### Contribute
If you have any suggestion or you found any bug in the code please report it as an Issue or [text me](mailto:lucasrg@kth.se). Furthermore, we are open to pull requests from the community!
