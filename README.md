# whatsapp-stats

This project is in current development. Its purpose is to provide a set of
tools to detect some hidden patterns in whatsapp group chats.

## Test

Test the program running `python main.py < file.in`, where file.in is the chat
you want to analyze.

### Comments on `file.in`

Email the chat of your whatsapp group using your phone. To do so, got to the
group conversation, click the three dots (up-right) and select More. Finally,
click on Email chat.

## Dependencies

Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

It is highly recommended (as well as being the simplest and easiest way) to install these dependencies with `pip` inside a virtual environment to keep
them isolated from the rest of the system.

### Virtualenv setup

Install virtualenv

`$ pip install virtualenv`

Create a new virtualenv (we name it `.env`)

`$ python3 -m venv .env`

Activate the environment

`$ . .env/bin/activate`

Install all the dependencies

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can exit the environment by typing

`$ deactivate`

I you modify the project using new libraries you might install, update the `requirements.txt` file

`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`
