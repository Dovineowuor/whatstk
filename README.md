### Installation

```
pip install whatstk
```

### Known issues

#### Header Support
The header of the chat log texts varies depending on your phone settings. We are making our best to provide support for all of them, but some might not be yet covered. Please check the list of supported headers in this [thread](https://github.com/lucasrodes/whatstk/issues/7) and comment if your header format is not supported!

#### Installation: bad interpreter
While running the installation, you might encounter an error like 

```
bad interpreter: No such file or directory
```

This is due to your directory being located within a path with spaces (more info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911003/cant-install-via-pip-with-virtualenv)). Please use a path without spaces!
